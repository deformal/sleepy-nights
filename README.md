# sleepy-nights

A soothing dark theme crafted for late-night coders who value focus and comfort. Sleepy Nights blends deep, muted blues and warm beige tones to reduce strain during long sessions and keep the code readable without harsh contrasts. The palette was carefully balanced to create a calm, cozy atmosphereâ€”like coding under a dim desk lamp at midnight.
